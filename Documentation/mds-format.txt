1. SCOPE
  The MDS file format is used to store information regarding a substrate.

2. FILE EXTENSION
  The file extension for an MDS file is .mds
  Files following the MDS standard must have
  their name terminate with .mds

3. FILE CONTENT
  An MDS file contains:
  * The substrate name
  * The file author
  * A description of the substrate
  * A "atom" block
  * A "bond" block
  * A "file end" marker

4. FILE STRUCTURE
  MDS files are parsed line by line.
  LINE 1:
    * Contains the substrate name.
    * Formatted as `<string>`
      * The string is the whole line
  LINE 2:
    * Contains the file author's identity.
    * Formatted as `<string>`
      * The string is the whole line
  LINE 3:
    * Contains a description of the substrate
    * Formatted as `<string>`
      * The string is the whole line
  LINE 4:
    * Contains information regarding the atom and bond count.
    * Formatted as `<int> <int>`
      * The first integer is the total number of atoms in the substrate.
      * The second integer is the total number of bonds between atoms.
  LINES 5 TO (5+ATOM_NUMBER-1):
    * Contain information regarding each atom in the system.
    * The atoms are assigned an ID based on the order on their lines.
      * The first atom line defines an atom with ID '1', second line ID '2', etc.
    * Formatted as `<double> <double> <double> <int> <double>`
      * The first three variables refer to the X Y Z coordinates of the atom
      * The first integer refers to the atom ID
        * The atom ID is defined by an MDM file
      * The next <double> refer to the electric charge (unit: C.e-1)
  LINES (5+ATOM_NUMBER) TO (5+ATOM_NUMBER+BOND_NUMBER-1)
    * Contain information regarding the bonds between the defined atoms
    * The bonds are treated as modeled as newtonian undamped harmonic oscillators
    * Formatted as `<int> <int> <double`
      * The two <int> refer to the bound atoms
      * The <double> refers to the Hooke constant
  LINE (5+ATOM_NUMBER+BOND_NUMBER)
