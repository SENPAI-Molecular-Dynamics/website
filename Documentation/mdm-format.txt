1. SCOPE
  The MDM file format is used to store information regarding a newtonian
  molecular dynamics model.

2. FILE EXTENSION
  The file extension for an MDM file is .mdm
  Files following the MDM standard must have
  their name terminate with .mdm

3. FILE CONTENT
  An MDM file contains:
  * A list of atoms
  * Their symbol
  * Their mass
  * Their covalent radius
  * Their Van der Waals radius
  * Their bond angle

4. FILE STRUCTURE
  MDM files are parsed line by line.
  Line 1:
    * Contains the model name.
    * Formatted as `<string>`
      * The string is the whole line
  Line 2:
    * Contains the file author's identity.
    * Formatted as `<string>`
      * The string is the whole line
  Line 3:
    * Contains a description of the substrate
    * Formatted as `<string>`
      * The string is the whole line
  Remaining lines:
    * Define the atoms
    * Each atom is assigned an ID based on their line number
      * The first atom to be defined is ID '1'
      * There is no ID '0'.
    * Each line is formatted as `<string> <string> <double> <double> <double> <double>`
      * First string: Name (Ex: Uranium, Carbon, SP3_Carbon)
      * Second string: Symbol (ex: H, Li, C, Be)
      * First double: Mass (kilograms)
      * Second double: Covalent radius (meters)
      * Third double: Van der Waals radius (meters)
      * Fourth double: bond angle (radians)
      * Fifth double: Lennard Jones epsilon
      * Sixth double: Lennard Jones sigma
