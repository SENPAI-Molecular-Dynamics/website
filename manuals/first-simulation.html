        <h1>SENPAI manuals - First simulation</h1>
        <p>This manual covers the basics of running simulations using SENPAI.<br/>
           At the end of the manual, the user is able to run basic SENPAI simulations.</p>



        <h2>Required software</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A working SENPAI installation</li>
            <li>A few MB of usable disk space (the size varies from simulation to simulation)</li>
        </ul>



        <h2>Calling SENPAI</h2>
        <p>SENPAI has no graphical user interface.<br/>
           Development of a web interface is in the works, but for now SENPAI is terminal only.</p>

        <p>SENPAI requires many parameters to run, which may take several lines on your terminal.<br/>
           We recommend using a shell script to call SENPAI. Shell scripts have many advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tweak parameters within the file: have the SENPAI parameters saved as shell variables and easily tweak simulations by editing a file.</li>
            <li>Share simulations: SENPAI already requires several files for a simulation. Easily share simulations by packaging the script with the other files !</li>
            <li>Repeatability: Just call the same file again instead of bothering with a cumbersome 12-line command.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>SENPAI will not have its own scripting language or interpreter.<br/>
           Shell scripting already works well enough and is flexible enough for everyone to enjoy and use their own way.<br/>
           Shell scripting also allows for advanced integration of SENPAI into existing and future toolchains, allowing for greater integration into existing workflows.</p>



        <h2>Writing a simulation script</h2>
        <p>This part is honnestly up to your own preferences. Everyone writes those scripts differently.<br/>
           Here's an example script if you want a place to start:</p>
        <p>#!/bin/bash<br/>
           <br/>
           #<br/>
           # 16-water.sh<br/>
           # SENPAI technological demonstration<br/>

           SIMULATION_NAME="16-water technologicial demonstration"<br/>
           AUTHOR_NAME="Chelsea Murgia"<br/>
           <br/>
           SUBSTRATE=water.mds<br/>
           SOLVENT=void.mds<br/>
           MODEL=senpai.mdm<br/>
           OUTPUT=16-water.xyz<br/>
           DURATION=0.1<br/>
           WATER_NB=16<br/>
           TARGET_POTENTIAL=0.1<br/>
           <br/>
           echo "[ INFO ] ${SIMULATION_NAME} by ${AUTHOR_NAME}"<br/>
           echo "[ INFO ] Starting SENPAI"<br/>
           senpai --substrate ${SUBSTRATE}\<br/>
                  --solvent ${SOLVENT} \<br/>
                  --out ${OUTPUT} \<br/>
                  --model ${MODEL} \<br/>
                  --time ${DURATION} \<br/>
                  --copy ${WATER_NB} \<br/>
                  --reduce_potential ${TARGET_POTENTIAL}<br/>
           <br/>
           if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then<br/>
             echo "[FAILED] SENPAI couldn't execute properly."<br/>
             exit 255<br/>
           else<br/>
             echo "[  OK  ] SENPAI executed properly"<br/>
             exit 0<br/>
           fi</p>
        
        <h2>List of SENPAI arguments</h2>
        <p>Here is the full list of arguments that can be passed to SENPAI:</p>
        <h3>--substrate [string]</h3>
            <p><strong>Required.</strong> Specifies the path to the substrate to simulate</p>
        <h3>--solvent [string]</h3>
            <p><strong>Required.</strong> Specified the path to the solvent file</p>
        <h3>--out [string]</h3>
            <p><strong>Required.</strong> Specifies the path to the output file</p>
        <h3>--model [string]</h3>
            <p><strong>Required.</strong> Specifies the path to the model file</p>
        <h3>--numerical</h3>
            <p>Configures the simulation to use numerical differentiation of the potential energy (defaults to analytical solving)</p>
        <h3>--numerical-tetra</h3>
            <p>Similar to --numerical, but numerical differentiation uses points in a tetrahedron instead of points in an octahedron</p>
        <h3>--time [double]</h3>
            <p>Specifies the simulation duration (ns) (defaults to 1ns)</p>
        <h3>--dt [double]</h3>
            <p>Specifies the timestep (fs) (defaults to 1 fs)</p>
        <h3>--temp [double]</h3>
            <p>Specifies the thermodynamic temperature of the system (K) (defaults to 298.15 K)</p>
        <h3>--pressure [double]</h3>
            <p>Specifies the pressure of the system (mbar) (defaults to 1 atm)</p>
        <h3>--density [double]</h3>
            <p>Specifies the density of the system (g.cm-3) (defaults to 1 g.cm-3)</p>
        <h3>--copy [unsigned integer]</h3>
            <p>Specifies how many copies of the loaded system are to be inserted in the simulation</p>
        <h3>--frameskip [unsigned integer]</h3>
            <p>Sets a frameskip to reduce I/O usage. Disabled by default</p>
        <h3>--reduce_potential [double]</h3>
            <p>Reduces the potential energy to the provided value (pJ) or lower (defaults to 10 pJ)</p>
        <h3>--srand [unsigned integer]</h3>
            <p>Specifies an unsigned integer seed for randomization. If the seed is not specified, the program will default to a random-enough seed.</p>



        <h2>Running the simulation</h2>
        <p>Call the script using your shell. Ensure the required files are located in the script's directory and SENPAI has read and write access to the directory.</p>
        <p>$ sh 16-water.sh</p>
        
        <p>SENPAI will proceed to load the substrate, dissolve it in the solvent, and reduce the system's potential energy to the specified target.<br/>
           This potential reduction phase preceeds the simulation which won't start before the target potential is reached.</p>
        
        <p>Once the target potential is reached, SENPAI will create an XYZ file (specified by the --out parameter) and write simulation data inside.<br/>
           The file is appended every frame with the data for each atom.</p>

        <p>Once SENPAI exits, the simulation is over and the rendered file can be opened by the user.</p>
