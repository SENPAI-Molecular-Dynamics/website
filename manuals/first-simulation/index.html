			<h1>SENPAI Manuals - First Simulation</h1>

			<h3>
				This manual covers the basics of running simulations using
				SENPAI. At the end of the manual, the user is able to run basic
				SENPAI simulations.
			</h3>
		</header>

		<main>
			<h2>Required software</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>A working SENPAI installation</li>
				<li>
					A few MB of usable disk space (the size varies from
					simulation to simulation)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Calling SENPAI</h2>
			<p>
				SENPAI has no graphical user interface. Development of a web
				interface is in the works, but for now SENPAI is terminal only.
			</p>

			<p>
				SENPAI requires many parameters to run, which may take several
				lines on your terminal. We recommend using a shell script to
				call SENPAI. Shell scripts have many advantages:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Tweak parameters within the file: have the SENPAI parameters
					saved as shell variables and easily tweak simulations by
					editing a file.
				</li>

				<li>
					Share simulations: SENPAI already requires several files for
					a simulation. Easily share simulations by packaging the
					script with the other files !
				</li>

				<li>
					Repeatability: Just call the same file again instead of
					bothering with a cumbersome 12-line command.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				SENPAI will not have its own scripting language or interpreter.
				Shell scripting already works well enough and is flexible enough
				for everyone to enjoy and use their own way. Shell scripting
				also allows for advanced integration of SENPAI into existing and
				future toolchains, allowing for greater integration into
				existing workflows.
			</p>

			<h2>Writing a simulation script</h2>

			<p>
				This part is honnestly up to your own preferences. Everyone
				writes those scripts differently. Here's an example script if
				you want a place to start:
			</p>

			<p>
				#!/bin/bash<br />
				<br />
				#<br />
				# 16-water.sh<br />
				# SENPAI technological demonstration<br />
				# 2022-01-07 Chelsea Murgia<br />
				#<br />
				<br />
				SIMULATION_NAME="16-water technologicial demonstration"<br />
				AUTHOR_NAME="Chelsea Murgia"<br />
				<br />
				SUBSTRATE=water.mds<br />
				SOLVENT=void.mds<br />
				MODEL=senpai.mdm<br />
				OUTPUT=16-water.xyz<br />
				DURATION=0.1<br />
				WATER_NB=16<br />
				TARGET_POTENTIAL=0.1<br />
				<br />
				echo "[ INFO ] ${SIMULATION_NAME} by ${AUTHOR_NAME}"<br />
				echo "[ INFO ] Starting SENPAI"<br />
				senpai --substrate ${SUBSTRATE}\<br />
				--solvent ${SOLVENT} \<br />
				--out ${OUTPUT} \<br />
				--model ${MODEL} \<br />
				--time ${DURATION} \<br />
				--copy ${WATER_NB} \<br />
				--reduce_potential ${TARGET_POTENTIAL}<br />
				<br />
				if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then<br />
				echo "[FAILED] SENPAI couldn't execute properly."<br />
				exit 255<br />
				else<br />
				echo "[ OK ] SENPAI executed properly"<br />
				exit 0<br />
				fi
			</p>

			<h2>List of SENPAI arguments</h2>

			<p>
				Here is the full list of arguments that can be passed to SENPAI:
			</p>

			<h3>--substrate [string]</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>Required.</strong> Specifies the path to the substrate
				to simulate
			</p>

			<h3>--solvent [string]</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>Required.</strong> Specified the path to the solvent
				file
			</p>

			<h3>--out [string]</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>Required.</strong> Specifies the path to the output file
			</p>

			<h3>--model [string]</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>Required.</strong> Specifies the path to the model file
			</p>

			<h3>--numerical</h3>

			<p>
				Configures the simulation to use numerical differentiation of
				the potential energy (defaults to analytical solving)
			</p>

			<h3>--numerical-tetra</h3>

			<p>
				Similar to --numerical, but numerical differentiation uses
				points in a tetrahedron instead of points in an octahedron
			</p>

			<h3>--time [double]</h3>

			<p>Specifies the simulation duration (ns) (defaults to 1ns)</p>

			<h3>--dt [double]</h3>

			<p>Specifies the timestep (fs) (defaults to 1 fs)</p>

			<h3>--temp [double]</h3>

			<p>
				Specifies the thermodynamic temperature of the system (K)
				(defaults to 298.15 K)
			</p>

			<h3>--pressure [double]</h3>

			<p>
				Specifies the pressure of the system (mbar) (defaults to 1 atm)
			</p>

			<h3>--density [double]</h3>

			<p>
				Specifies the density of the system (g.cm-3) (defaults to 1
				g.cm-3)
			</p>

			<h3>--copy [unsigned integer]</h3>

			<p>
				Specifies how many copies of the loaded system are to be
				inserted in the simulation
			</p>

			<h3>--frameskip [unsigned integer]</h3>

			<p>Sets a frameskip to reduce I/O usage. Disabled by default</p>

			<h3>--reduce_potential [double]</h3>

			<p>
				Reduces the potential energy to the provided value (pJ) or lower
				(defaults to 10 pJ)
			</p>

			<h3>--srand [unsigned integer]</h3>

			<p>
				Specifies an unsigned integer seed for randomization. If the
				seed is not specified, the program will default to a
				random-enough seed.
			</p>

			<h2>Running the simulation</h2>

			<p>
				Call the script using your shell. Ensure the required files are
				located in the script's directory and SENPAI has read and write
				access to the directory.
			</p>

			<p>$ sh 16-water.sh</p>

			<p>
				SENPAI will proceed to load the substrate, dissolve it in the
				solvent, and reduce the system's potential energy to the
				specified target. This potential reduction phase preceeds the
				simulation which won't start before the target potential is
				reached.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once the target potential is reached, SENPAI will create an XYZ
				file (specified by the --out parameter) and write simulation
				data inside. The file is appended every frame with the data for
				each atom.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once SENPAI exits, the simulation is over and the rendered file
				can be opened by the user.
			</p>
