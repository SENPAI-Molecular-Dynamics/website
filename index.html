				<h2>What is SENPAI?</h2>

				<p>
					SENPAI (Simplified Evolutive N-body Processing And
					Integration) is a free, open source molecular dynamics
					simulator licensed under the GPLv3.
				</p>

				<p>
					Given 3D representations of chemical substrates (to the
					atomic level), and a user-selected mathematical model of the
					universe, SENPAI will simulate the motion within 3D space of
					the provided substrates and provide the user with a plethora
					of information regarding the state of each atom during the
					simulation.
				</p>

				<p>
					SENPAI provides many tunable parameters, and allows for
					flawless script integration to better incorporate SENPAI in
					your workflow.

				<h2>Noteworthy Features</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Integrated potential reduction:</strong> Easily
						mitigate the issue of "garbage in, garbage out"! If told
						to do so, SENPAI will reduce the potential energy of the
						system to a user-selected target value before
						simulating. SENPAI sequentially runs several algorithms
						like gradient descent to properly set the system up for
						simulation.
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Analytical differentiation:</strong> Traditional
						MD simulators compute a particle's total potential and
						numerically differentiate it to compute the applied
						force. SENPAI analytically solves for the force vector,
						resulting in an extreme speedup. Should you prefer
						numerical potential differentiation, SENPAI offers two
						different numerical differentiation methods which can be
						configured as well!
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Easy to use file formats:</strong> The MDS, MDM,
						and MDP file formats developped for SENPAI can be
						hand-written! No need for special software. Quickly and
						easily prepare simulations and adjust them with no
						hassle. Simulations are rendered as XYZ, and can be
						immediately viewed using existing software without prior
						conversion!
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong>Efficient computing model:</strong> the ONICHaN
						(Optimized Numerical Integration, Classical Harmonics,
						and N-body) model was tailored for SENPAI over months of
						work. Inspired by the AMBER family of force fields, it
						allows SENPAI to compute forces with unprecedented
						efficiency.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>[2022-01-11] SENPAI has hit release 1.0 !</h3>
				<p>
					It's been years since work started on SENPAI. Well, here it
					is. SENPAI is fully usable as a molecular dynamics
					simulator.<br />
					This doesn't mean it's done. There are still many features
					to be added, like solvation, fully implementing models
					instead of the current hardcoding... But this is it, SENPAI
					is usable. Have fun with it, start poking around with, maybe
					send us some feedback. Either way, thanks to the people
					around the world who have been supporting the project since
					its inception in 2018.
